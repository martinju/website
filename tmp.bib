  abstract={We seek to narrow the gap between parametric and nonparametric modelling of stationary time series processes. The approach is inspired by recent advances in focused inference and model selection techniques. The paper generalises and extends recent work by developing a new version of the focused information criterion (FIC), directly comparing the performance of parametric time series models with a nonparametric alternative. For a pre-specified focused parameter, for which scrutiny is considered valuable, this is achieved by comparing the mean squared error of the model-based estimators of this quantity. In particular, this yields FIC formulae for covariances or correlations at
specified lags, for the probability of reaching a threshold, etc. Suitable weighted average versions, the AFIC, also lead to model selection strategies for finding the best model for
the purpose of estimating e.g. a sequence of correlations.}

  abstract={We analyze the distribution of T-cell clonotypes in a compartment like blood based on samples. In particular, we study how the distribution of clonotype frequencies changes between different samples. We consider this as a sampling problem and formulate the problem as a generalization of the classical statistical problem of comparing samples from an urn. Due to the low sampling size compared to the number of different clonotypes in the entire sampling space, the classical methodology that works directly with clonotype frequencies in samples is not suited. We approach this challenge by representing other properties of the sample. Our re-representation allows for easy sampling model fitting and testing under natural model conditions. Although we here focus on the application on clonotypes, the new methodology generalizes seamlessly to other applications.}
