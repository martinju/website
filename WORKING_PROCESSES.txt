### Add new publications ####

1. Add the new publications to my_publications_website.bib
                  and preprints to my_preprints_website.bib
    Make sure the bib includes the full abstract, doi and all other necessary information
    Make sure to use @unpublished for any non-peer reviewed papers: Arxiv, NR notes etc
    USE @inproceedings for conference papers
2. Start the terminal and run the following command:
academic import --bibtex my_publications_website.bib
and/or
academic import --bibtex my_preprints_website.bib

(requires python + academic python module installed, see https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/publications/)
3. For all preprints, change publication_type from 2 to 3
3. Add pdf with the same name as the folder to the folder
4. Add a photo by adding that to the folder too (?)
