summary: Introducing the topic of prediction explanation and Shapley values + some words on our methods for accounting for the feature dependence
abstract: 'Why did just you get a rejection on your loan application? Why was the price of your car insurance higher than that of your neighbor? More and more such decisions are made by complex statistical methods/machine learning models based on relevant data. Such methods are often referred to as "black boxes” due to the difficulty of understanding how they work and produce different predictions. As these methods become increasingly more important for individuals in our society, there is a clear need for methods which can help us understand such predictions, that is “opening the black box”. In this talk, I will motivate why this is useful and important. I will further discuss how Shapley values from game theory can be used as an explanation framework, and emphasize the importance of accounting for the covariate/feature dependence when estimating the Shapley values.'
