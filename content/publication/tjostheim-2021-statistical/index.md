abstract: 'There has been an intense recent activity in embedding of very high dimensional
  and nonlinear data structures, much of it in the data science and machine learning
  literature. We survey this activity in four parts. In the first part we cover nonlinear
  methods such as principal curves, multidimensional scaling, local linear methods,
  ISOMAP, graph based methods and kernel based methods. The second part is concerned
  with topological embedding methods, in particular mapping topological properties
  into persistence diagrams. Another type of data sets with a tremendous growth is
  very high-dimensional network data. The task considered in part three is how to
  embed such data in a vector space of moderate dimension to make the data amenable
  to traditional techniques such as cluster and classification techniques. The final
  part of the survey deals with embedding in R2, which is visualization. Three methods
  are presented: t-SNE, UMAP and LargeVis based on methods in parts one, two and three,
  respectively. The methods are illustrated and compared on two simulated data sets;
  one consisting of a triple of noisy Ranunculoid curves, and one consisting of networks
  of increasing complexity and with two types of nodes.'
