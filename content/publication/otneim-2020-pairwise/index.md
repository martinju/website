abstract: The Fisher discriminant is probably the best known likelihood discriminant
  for continuous data. Another benchmark discriminant is the naive Bayes, which is
  based on marginals only. In this paper we extend both discriminants by modeling
  dependence between pairs of variables. In the continuous case this is done by local
  Gaussian versions of the Fisher discriminant. In the discrete case the naive Bayes
  is extended by taking geometric averages of pairwise joint probabilities. We also
  indicate how the two approaches can be combined for mixed continuous and discrete
  data. The new discriminants show promising results in a number of simulation experiments
  and real data illustrations.
