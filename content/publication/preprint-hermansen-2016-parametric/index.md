abstract: We seek to narrow the gap between parametric and nonparametric modelling
  of stationary time series processes. The approach is inspired by recent advances
  in focused inference and model selection techniques. The paper generalises and extends
  recent work by developing a new version of the focused information criterion (FIC),
  directly comparing the performance of parametric time series models with a nonparametric
  alternative. For a pre-specified focused parameter, for which scrutiny is considered
  valuable, this is achieved by comparing the mean squared error of the model-based
  estimators of this quantity. In particular, this yields FIC formulae for covariances
  or correlations at specified lags, for the probability of reaching a threshold,
  etc. Suitable weighted average versions, the AFIC, also lead to model selection
  strategies for finding the best model for the purpose of estimating e.g. a sequence
  of correlations.
