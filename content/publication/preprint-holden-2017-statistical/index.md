abstract: We analyze the distribution of T-cell clonotypes in a compartment like blood
  based on samples. In particular, we study how the distribution of clonotype frequencies
  changes between different samples. We consider this as a sampling problem and formulate
  the problem as a generalization of the classical statistical problem of comparing
  samples from an urn. Due to the low sampling size compared to the number of different
  clonotypes in the entire sampling space, the classical methodology that works directly
  with clonotype frequencies in samples is not suited. We approach this challenge
  by representing other properties of the sample. Our re-representation allows for
  easy sampling model fitting and testing under natural model conditions. Although
  we here focus on the application on clonotypes, the new methodology generalizes
  seamlessly to other applications.
