abstract: The Greenland Sea is an important breeding ground for harp and hooded seals.
  Estimates of annual seal pup production are critical factors in the estimation of
  abundance that is needed for management of the species. These estimates are usually
  based on counts from aerial photographic surveys. However, only a minor part of
  the whelping region can be photographed, because of its large extent. To estimate
  total seal pup production, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach
  motivated by viewing the seal pup appearances as a realization of a log‐Gaussian
  Cox process by using covariate information from satellite imagery as a proxy for
  ice thickness. For inference, we utilize the stochastic partial differential equation
  module of the integrated nested Laplace approximation framework. In a case‐study
  using survey data from 2012, we compare our results with existing methodology in
  a comprehensive cross‐validation study. The results of the study indicate that our
  method improves local estimation performance, and that the increased uncertainty
  of prediction of our method is required to obtain calibrated count predictions.
  This suggests that the sampling density of the survey design may not be sufficient
  to obtain reliable estimates of seal pup production.
