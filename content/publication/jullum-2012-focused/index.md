abstract: In this thesis we develop Focus Information Criteria (FIC) for a number
  of situations concerning model selection among nonparametric and parametric models.
  We mainly handle the one-sample case of fully observed independent identically distributed
  (i.i.d.) data, but also work in the more general setting with censored data. In
  addition, the regression setting and two-sample situation are discussed. Our criteria
  are based on asymptotic theory. Maximum likelihood theory outside model conditions
  and nonparametrics via statistical functionals are central. For our main criterion
  we state weak sufficient conditions, show strong consistency of the intermediate
  estimators and study the criterionâ€™s properties both in the limit and for finite
  samples. It turns out that the criterion has certain desirable properties making
  it asymptotically superior to other information criteria like AIC and BIC in a fairly
  wide class of situations. We also develop weighted versions of some of the schemes
  and discuss the link between such a criterion and a certain class of goodness of
  fit tests. Model averaging is also discussed in terms of the derived schemes. We
  propose a model averaging generalization of the FIC schemes and derive the limiting
  distribution of the final estimator under a few conditions. Some of the criteria
  are applied to real data examples using the R function that is developed.
