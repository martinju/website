abstract: Factor models have become a common and valued tool for understanding the
  risks associated with an investing strategy. In this report we describe Exabel's
  factor model, we quantify the fraction of the variability of the returns explained
  by the different factors, and we show some examples of annual returns of portfolios
  with different factor exposure.
