abstract: Working in a Bayesian framework, we have derived a procedure for inverting
  rock properties based on geophysical data. The purpose was to arrive at a widely
  applicable and general procedure in which few and weak assumptions are required
  for application to various inverse problems within the geophysical industry. Our
  Bayesian statistical approach combines sampling-based techniques and Gaussian approximations
  to assess local approximations to quantities related to the posterior distribution
  of rock properties. These approximated quantities define the Bayesian inversion.
  A conceptual advantage of our approach is that there are few restrictions on the
  initial model, allowing realistic statistical models to be approximated directly.
  The methodology is easily parallelized and offers a range of procedures, which gives
  a trade-off between inversion speed and accuracy. We have tested the approach in
  a monitoring setting using seismic amplitudes by evaluating a synthetic case and
  real data from the Sleipner CO2 injection project. For the synthetic case, the inversion
  results correspond well with the rock properties used to generate the data and the
  posterior distribution derived using an MCMC approach. We also found improved accuracy
  compared with a frequently used Gaussian inversion approach. In the real data case,
  we clearly identified high-saturation layers present in previous qualitative interpretations.
