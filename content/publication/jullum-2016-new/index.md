abstract: This thesis comprises the work conducted during three years as a PhD student
  at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo (UiO). I will be looking
  back at these years as an enjoyable phase of my life, in which I learned a lot.
  The period has also been tough, though -- possibly even tougher than I expected
  it to be. With the finished thesis in my hand, there is however no doubt it was
  worth it. Still, I have to agree with the author Joseph Epstein who noted that it
  is a lot better to have written, than to actually be writing. The final product
  constituting my PhD thesis is inarguably positively correlated with the original
  project description, although the rho is far from one. Through these years I have
  been working with methodology within a broad range of fields across the science
  of statistics. Among them are approximate Bayesian inference, asymptotic theory,
  Bayesian statistics, copulae, density estimation, frequentist statistics, functional
  differentiation, Gaussian distribution theory, geostatistics, inverse problems,
  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), model averaging, model selection, spatial statistics,
  stochastic process theory, survival analysis, time series modelling – and I even
  had to learn a little bit of geophysics, petrophysics and rock physics. I do by
  no means claim to master all these subjects, but I have learned a fair amount about
  all of them, and for that I feel incredibly lucky.  Upon completing this thesis,
  I am deeply indebted to my two supervisors Nils Lid Hjort and Odd Kolbjørnsen. I
  am truly grateful for how you inspired me, and the eagerness you showed while working
  with the various projects. I will sincerely like to thank you both for that. You
  also supported me and made it possible for me to spend the autumn of 2014 at Stanford
  University, visiting Paul Switzer at the Department of Statistics. Paul was an outstanding
  host during some incredible months over there – our delightful academic and non-academic
  discussions will not be easily forgotten. Being founded by Statistics for Innovation
  (SFI2), a centre for research-based innovation, I was lucky enough to be awarded
  with two offices in Oslo; one at the campus at Blindern and one at the Norwegian
  Computing Center (NR) at Forskningsparken. Without even being employed at NR, I
  was very well taken care of and included in the SAND group. I am thankful for that
  additional dimension and opportunity to learn, and for being exposed to the weekly
  dose of Thursday-buns – that will be missed! I would also like to thank all my colleagues,
  both at the statistics group at UiO and the SAND group at NR. Special thanks go
  to my ‘roommates’ Marie at NR and Reinaldo at UiO for all our inviting discussions
  and fascinating conversations, and to Gudmund Horn Hermansen for co-authoring one
  of the papers in the thesis. Finally, I would like to thank my friends, family,
  and ‘family-in-law’ for filling my life with joy – especially my wonderful Elin
  for putting up with me, supporting and understanding me, even though I know you
  really wished I was rather spending those late evenings and weekends with you.
