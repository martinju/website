abstract: We seek to narrow the gap between parametric and nonparametric modelling
  of stationary time series pro- cesses. The approach is inspired by recent advances
  in focused inference and model selection techniques.Our paper generalises and extends
  current work by developing a new version of the focused information criterion (FIC),
  directly comparing the performance of both parametric and nonparametric time series
  models. This is achieved by comparing the mean squared error for estimating a focus
  parameter under consideration, for each candidate model. In particular this yields
  FIC formulae for covariances or correlations at specified lags, for the probability
  of reaching a threshold, etc. Suitable weighted average versions, the AFIC, also
  lead to model selection strategies for finding the best model for the purpose of
  estimating e.g. a sequence of correlations.
