abstract: We derive a Bayesian statistical procedure for inversion of geophysical
  data to rock properties. The procedure is for simplicity presented in the seismic
  AVO setting where rock properties influence the data through elastic parameters.
  The framework may however easily be extended. The procedure combines sampling based
  techniques and a compound Gaussian approximation to assess local approximations
  to marginal posterior distributions of rock properties, which the inversion is based
  on. The framework offers a range of approximations where inversion speed and accuracy
  may be balanced. The approach is also well suited for parallelisation, making it
  attractive for large inversion problems. We apply the procedure to a 4D CO2 monitoring
  case with focus on predicting saturation content. Promising results are obtained
  for both synthetic and real data. Finally we compare our method with regular linear
  Gaussian inversion for density prediction, where our method gives an improved fit.
