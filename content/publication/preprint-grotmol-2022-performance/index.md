abstract: Quantifying both historic and future volatility is key in portfolio risk
  management. This note presents and compares estimation strategies for volatility
  estimation in an estimation universe consisting on 28 629 unique companies from
  February 2010 to April 2021, with 858 different portfolios. The estimation methods
  are compared in terms of how they rank the volatility of the different subsets of
  portfolios. The overall best performing approach estimates volatility from direct
  entity returns using a GARCH model for variance estimation.
