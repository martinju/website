I am a Senior Research Scientist at the Norwegian Computing
Center (NR) and has a PhD in mathematical statistics from the University of Oslo. 
My research interests is currently oriented around Explainable AI (XAI) with particular emphasis on Shapley values. 

This site is under construction. In the meanwhile, please see my [Google scholar site](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=no&user=lbqfMroAAAAJ).

I also conduct research within point processes and network analysis, supervise on both PhD and master's level, do not linger when it comes to applying state-of-the-art machine learning methodology, and do the majority of my daily programming in R.

 After fairly theoretical master’s and PhD work, he started to develop methodology for more applied problems at NR. Since then, Jullum has worked on both academic research and state-of-the-art ML methodology applied to industrial and public sector problems. The last couple of years, Jullums 

Jullum is also co-director for the personalized fraud detection group of BigInsight.

Through this work, Jullum developed a deep interest for the understanding of
the complex machine learning methods and their lack of explainability. Jullum’s solid theoretical background,
experience developing methodology and broad work with applied machine learning puts him in a unique position
to make predictions interpretable.

Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
