#### TODO

1. Add all my publications to my_publications_website.bib and run the generator
2. Add all pds too
3. Delete the samples (in a separate commit to easily get it back)
4. Add all my talks in the same fashion as for the publications (separate bib file)
  (may want to check out the cms importer first to see if I can use that)
5. Add publications and talks to the main site with a "featured" tab
